# HotelBookingSite
Hotel Booking Site built on JSP, Bootstrap and MySQL.

## Steps to run aplication

1) git clone https://github.com/e-business-app/HotelBookingSite.git

2) There will be a database folder with a .sql file, run the sql file and save the database as Hotel DB.

3) Copy git cloned folder to Eclipse and save the project as **testJSP** (this is really important, as I have used one absolute URL for the navigation bar.)

4) Start your tomcat server and check it out, hotels listing, check for availability, temporary session saved booking and followed by final booking features have been added.
